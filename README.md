# Security Challenge Notes 📓

> These are my notes for completed and in-progress security challenges, be it for job interviews or just personal learning, they will all be here.

## Purpose 📝

Follow along and see how I think and approach these problems as I attempt them. I will also be throwing the pages and resources that I use while doing these
challenges in my notes so you can learn alongside me.

That being said, I wish you all good luck in your studying and welcome to the inside of my head. **Enjoy your stay!** 👋

## Disclaimer 🔔

This repo should not be used find the answer to any of these problems but rather as a resource to move past a blocker while you are working on the same problem. 

It goes without saying but ***You will not learn if you only ever copy answers and never attempt these problems on your own***!
