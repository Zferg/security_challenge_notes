# My Notes/Work for Security Challenges üìù

These are my notes for completed and in-progress security challenges, be it for job interviews or just personal learning, they will all be here.

I hope you can follow along and see how I think and approach these problems as I attempt them. I will also be throwing the pages and resources that I use while doing these
challenges in my notes so you can learn alongside me.

This repo should not be used find the answer to any of these problems but rather as a resource to move past a blocker while you are working on the same problem. 

It goes without saying but ***You will not learn if you only ever copy answers and never attempt these problems on your own***!

That being said, I wish you all good luck in your studying and welcome to the inside of my head. **Enjoy your stay!** üëã
